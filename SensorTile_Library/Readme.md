Library for the new and improved STM32L432-based Sensor Tile, with BME280 pressure/temperature/humidity sensor, CCS811 equivalent CO2 and Volatile Organics sensor, and BMA280 accelerometer for low frequency vibrations and tap/orientation detection.

Also on the board are the ICS43434 I2S digital microphone, a 1 MByte SPI NOR flash memory, and the BMD-350 (nRF52) BLE module for wireless connectivity.

The 20 mm x 20 mm sensor tile also has a variety of indicator leds, a user/boot button, and a MAX1555 LiPo battery charger.
